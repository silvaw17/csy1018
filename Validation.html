  <h2>My experience </h2>
 
 <p>This is the first time I use HTML and CSS, I was new to this but in a few weeks of reading and watching a video, i manage to get familiar with it. just by starting to design my assignment projector I was able to learn much quicker and easier as I could see what I was doing.I think it has been a great experience and can't wait to start learning more. I think one of my biggest problems was learning the CSS which was hard.the positioning ,flexbox, and grid were a bit confusing at first.I had a lot of videos about these parts as is what makes your website look better . anther issue was making my website responsive. this part I think is the hardest if you are new to all this but i manage to do it.As it shows on the image above I had a few errors in my HTML code that I was unable to fix also in my CSS I had about 2 or 3 errors as well that was unable to fix. but overall I think my website looks good for a first website it could do with a lot of more improvements and make it even more mobile friendly.I aim to learn everything there is to know about web development and take this learning further </p>
